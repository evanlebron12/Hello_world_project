                        <p>The first big story I see on Forbes for 2022 is virtual reality, I'm sure everyone has heard of virtual reality by now but if you have not virtual reality is an environment generated around you in which you are in that environment through a VR headset. In 2022 they had become more affordable along with better graphics being able to interact with others. From my friends that have VR headsets, I've heard them say they were intrigued at first and just didn't see the interest in it after a while.</p>
                        <p>Another advancement would be cloud gaming as this allows us as the consumer not to have to upgrade to a new console every 5 years or so this also allows for the programmers and designers more time on their products. Along with giving gamers the benefit of not having to upgrade when their console may be just fine. Along with cutting down on unnecessary waste within the environment, it can be a lot when you have millions of people buying these consoles.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, how nfts and blockchain have played a role within the gaming community. As there were companies that had come out according to Forbes saying that Square Enix and Ubisoft were going to launch nft on their gaming websites. As I see this as being a benefit to the user as when I personally would be more enticed to buy things on a gaming platform that I could sell back to another user, as I feel we still have a while to go before this would be widely implemented.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the gaming industry still has great room for advancement if that advancement comes through the same medium of use that is used right now I'm not sure. Although with virtual reality and it's advancements I could see users turn that way with graphics improving and making you feel like you are actually there in real life. Who knows how long it may take to get us to that point of advancement but I'm sure it may happen one day.</p>
